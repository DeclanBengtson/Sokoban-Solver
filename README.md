# Sokoban-Solver
This project was developed as part of a team assessment for an artificial intelligence unit at university.
Sokoban is a puzzle game where the player pushes boxes around an environment in order to place them in a designated location.
This implementation models robots moving around a warehouse to reach a goal state.
All files except the mySokobanSolver file were provided as a framework for the assessment.
The project required for us to implement various functions to initialise the board, identify taboo cells within the warehouses and implement search functions provided in the search.py file.</br>
The aim of the assignment was to design and implement a planning agent for Sokoban.</br>
